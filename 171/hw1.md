Homework 1

1.
  - **intelligence**: the ability to acquire and analyze information from the environment, infer a certain, appropriate action, and execute that action reasonably.
  - **artificial intelligence**: much like **intelligence**, but exercising those traits using a mechanical or electronic process.
  - **agent**: an agent is the entity possessing the traits above described as intelligent; artificial or otherwise. That is to say the agent is both the entity and the traits.
  - **logical reasoning**:

  - I would say the only objections that *may* hold weight are Lady Lovelace's, continuity of the nervous system, and informality of behavior. It seems these particular objections remain relevant because they are either still true or they keep relativity in mind. As mentioned in the text, Lovelace wasn't convinced that the technology of her time could do anything new. It can be expressed more generally that with X current technology, computers probably can do action Y; this might always be true. As for the nervous system and informality of behavior, our minds and the process by which they work is still very unexplored scientifically. We still have yet to create a system that has these properties. We might have Watson that can win on Jeopardy, but we also have (or had) a nazi twitter account that didn't have the rule of conduct most humans share.

  Turing's refutations seem to be centered around logic and the idea that it's not about asking if computers can think the same way as humans. That's what the Turing Test is for; given that a machine can pass X Turing Test, it has the ability to perform a subset of actions Y.

  If I were to have one objection as to if machines can think, I would object that even if machines could form new thoughts and be aware of them, it would be fundamentally different from how we have defined thought.

  According to "the University's School of Systems Engineering in partnership with RoboLaw, an EU-funded organisation examining the regulation of emerging robotic technologies...Eugene [Goostman] managed to convince 33% of the human judges (30 judges took part) that it [a simulated 13-year-old boy] was human". With that I'd say we've already reached that milestone and that 30% probability will be a lot higher in the next 50 years.
