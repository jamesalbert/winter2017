##### Homework 1

**most of discussion was taken up by homework review**

Problem solving agents try to solve a problem, duh
  - finding the shortest path between two cities
    - task environment:
      - discrete
      - single agent
      - episodic
      - fully observable
      - deterministic
      - static

chapter 3 is about search
to solve a problem by search:
  - very similar to shortest path in map
    - designing state space in a meaningful way

uninformed:
  - depth-first
  - breadth first
  - uniform cost

informed
  - best first
  - greedy
  - memory efficient
