Poisson distribution 10 hours

each train takes 3.5-4.5 hours uniformly at random to unload

priority queue when dock is busy (FIFO)

entry/departure time negligible

workers can only work 12 hours at a time

when train arrives, remaining work time is uniformly distributed at random between 6-11 hours

μ = average number of times the train arrives at docking station
x = actual number       "       "       "       "
P(x; μ) = the poisson probability that exactly x arrivals occur when mean number = μ

P(x; μ) = (e^-μ) * (μ^x) / x!
